## Command-line Interface Usages

### Historical Data Download & Processing

Update all `K_1M` and `K_DAY` interval historical K-line data

    python main_backend.py -u   /   python main_backend.py --update

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This will not override existing historical data if the file exists. It will automatically detect
the latest stock data you have downloaded in the folder and resume from there.

If you want to refresh all data, use the following command instead (WITH CAUTION!)

    python main_backend.py -fu   /   python main_backend.py --force_update

### Algorithmic Trading

Execute Algorithmic Trading with a Pre-defined Strategy (By default use **1M data**)

    python main_backend.py -s MACD_Cross   /   python main_backend.py --strategy MACD_Cross

If you would like to use another time interval based date (e.g., Day data), use the following command

    python main_backend.py -s MACD_Cross --time_interval K_DAY

If you do not have a pre-defined stock list in `config.ini`, then you can just trade the Top 30 HSI stocks

    python main_backend.py -s MACD_Cross --include_hsi --time_interval K_DAY

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The supported time intervals are: K_1M, K_30M, K_5M, K_15M, K_30M, K_60M, K_DAY, K_WEEK, K_MON,
K_YEAR.

### Stock Filtering and Email Subscription

## Disclaimer

Futures, stocks and options trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The
valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original
investment. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged
nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this
can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains.

If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account.
You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not
engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of
your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent advice from your financial
advisor.

All trading strategies are used at your own risk.

Any content in this repository should not be relied upon as advice or construed as providing recommendations of any
kind. It is your responsibility to confirm and decide which trades to make. Trade only with risk capital; that is, trade
with money that, if lost, will not adversely impact your lifestyle and your ability to meet your financial obligations.
Past results are no indication of future performance. In no event should the content of this correspondence be construed
as an express or implied promise or guarantee.

This repository and its author are not responsible for any losses incurred as a result of using any of our trading
strategies. Loss-limiting strategies such as stop loss orders may not be effective because market conditions or
technological issues may make it impossible to execute such orders. Likewise, strategies using combinations of options
and/or futures positions such as “spread” or “straddle” trades may be just as risky as simple long and short positions.
Information provided in this correspondence is intended solely for informational purposes and is obtained from sources
believed to be reliable. Information is in no way guaranteed. No guarantee of any kind is implied or possible where
projections of future conditions are attempted.
